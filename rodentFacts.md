#Random Rodent Facts

## General Rodentia

* The largest living rodent is the Capybara, a semiaquatic rodents that averages between 1.5 to 2 feet tall. They're about the size of a medium to large dog.
* The smallest living rodents are the Pygmy Jerboa and the African Pygmy Mouse. Adults average about 1.7 inches long, not including their tail. With the tail, they're often around 3 inches long.

## Hamsters

* There are five domesticated species of hamsters: Syrian hamsters, Campell's Dwarf hamsters, Russian/Winter White Dwarf Hamsters, Chinese hamsters, and Roborovski dwarf hamsters.
* Roborovksi dwarf hamsters' hind legs are set further apart than their front legs for greater running speed.
* Hamster cheek pouches can extend all the way down to their hips.
* Hamsters blink far less often than humans, and they only blink one eye at a time. It's thought this is a survival adaptation, so that while they are awake, they always have at least one eye open to notice movement and potential predators.
